###libcoap

语言: ``C``

> Lightweight application-protocol for devices that are constrained their resources such as computing power, RF range, memory, bandwith, or network packet sizes. This protocol, CoAP, is developed in the IETF working group "CoRE", <http://6lowapp.net>.

###jCoAP

语言: ``Java``

> jCoAP is a Java Library implementing the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)


###Node-CoAP

语言: ``Javascript`` (Nodejs)
> node-coap is a client and server library for CoAP modelled after the http module.

###coap

语言: ``Python``

> A CoAP Python library

> This package implements the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) developed by the IETF CORE working group.

###Californium (Cf) CoAP 

语言: ``Java``

> Californium (Cf) is an open source implementation of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). It is written in Java and targets unconstrained environments such as back-end service infrastructures (e.g., proxies, resource directories, or management services) and less constrained environments such as embedded devices running Linux (e.g., smart home controllers or vehicle sensors). Californium (Cf) has been running code for the IETF standardization of CoAP and was recently reimplemented to straighten changed design decisions, but also to improve its performance with focus on scalability. The new implementation was successfully tested at the ETSI CoAP#3 and OMA LWM2M Plugtests in November 2013.
