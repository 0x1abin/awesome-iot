###Californium (Cf) CoAP 

语言: ``Java``

主页: [https://github.com/mkovatsc/Californium](https://github.com/mkovatsc/Californium)

> Californium (Cf) is an open source implementation of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). It is written in Java and targets unconstrained environments such as back-end service infrastructures (e.g., proxies, resource directories, or management services) and less constrained environments such as embedded devices running Linux (e.g., smart home controllers or vehicle sensors). Californium (Cf) has been running code for the IETF standardization of CoAP and was recently reimplemented to straighten changed design decisions, but also to improve its performance with focus on scalability. The new implementation was successfully tested at the ETSI CoAP#3 and OMA LWM2M Plugtests in November 2013.
